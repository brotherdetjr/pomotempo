# PomoTempo
This is a widget for modified Pomodoro technique.
It allows to set up arbitrary time from 5 mins to 1 hour with five-minute step.

Main ideas:
* Simplicity and minimalism
* Yet perfect UX
* One-page Web application
* Nothing persisted to server, only to local browser storage
* Multiple browser support (including mobile version and fresh versions of IE)

Features pending:
* History of timer triggerings
* Fancy animation in the end of the time period - to bring a bit of play-factor, and to draw user's attention when the time is up
* ??? Requests are welcome (raise issue)

Features out of scope:
* No resting times, at least for now
* No "Pause" button
